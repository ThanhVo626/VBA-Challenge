# VBA-Challenges
I worked on this alone.
Code I had to search outside of class was 
"For each ws In ThisWorkbook.Worksheets" and "CDbl".
I believe we talked about going from worksheet to worksheet in class but I forgot how to do it.
I was initially trying to use "Cint" but the numbers in the worksheets were to big and learned that double was able to hold a larger amount of digits.
